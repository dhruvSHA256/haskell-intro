You can use this subdirectory to play around with Haskell
and do self-test questions. Haskell Language Server will work
for all `*.hs` files you make here as long as you stick to
base package only.

If you need to import modules than come from other packages
(like `System.Random`) you need to create a .cabal file
as described [in this video](https://teaching.well-typed.com/courses/intro/io-and-explicit-effects.html#video-57-excursion-working-with-packages).
